## 💡Inspiration
Hustle culture has engulfed us. The insatiable hunger of accomplishments looms over our everyday lives. With everything happening so quickly, sometimes we really just need to take a walk down memory lane—and that’s exactly what Memlane is for.

## 🔍 What it does
Memlane is a mobile app that helps you discover where memories are made. Memlane pins memories to the locations in which they were created, helping you trace the places you’ve been to and the experiences you’ve had. As you travel, you can also explore the memories that others have created nearby and how different spaces evolve over time.

Simply create an account, log in, and journey your experiences as you go! You can also view and react to other people’s memories as you come across them. Sharing and reliving memories has never been easier!

## ⚙️ How we built it
Our app was bootstrapped with Expo and Supabase. It was built using TypeScript & React Native and is accessible for both iOS and Android devices.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
It was our team’s first exposure to both Expo Go and React Native, which proved to be a challenging (but fun!) learning curve. iOS development posed some niche challenges, in combination with manipulating the MapView & camera APIs.

## ✔️ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created a functioning iOS and Android mobile app
Allows users to share their memories with others on the platform
Implement location tracking in the map

## 📚 What we learned
How to spin up an Expo Go app
Learning how to better grapple with various APIs

## 🔭 What's next for Memlane
Memlane intends to polish up certain features (camera & map display). With a few more tweaks, we could potentially be bringing Memlane to the general public.
